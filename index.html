            <h3>WELCOME TO MY <br> FIRST WEBPAGE</h3>
            <p><b>Hello, my name is Greg and I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</b></p>

            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Montana. After graduation, I worked with
                people diagnosed with
                moderate to severe mental illness as a caseworker and a mental health worker. I value the time I spent
                working there and most
                of all, the people I met. I think the skills acquired from my degree and the work I was involved in will
                benefit me in regards
                to being a software developer in the following ways:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Good communication skills.</li>

                <li>Being sympathetic and understanding with colleagues and/or clients.</li>

                <li>Working well with others in a team setting.</li>

                <li>Being committed and disciplined.</li>

                <li>Persistence persistence persistence.</li>

            </ol>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I'm originally from Missoula, Montana and have lived in Minneapolis for over two years. My partner and I
                moved to Minneapolis where I was hired as a caseworker for adults with severe and persistent mental illness. 
                After some time passed, I realized I wanted to change professions for various reasons. In the last semester 
                of my senior year, I took an intro web development class and loved it. Considering it was the last semester 
                of my college career, I thought it was too late to change careers. I have since realized that I should pursue 
                what I really want in life at all costs. I have always been passionate about creating and understanding various 
                things in the world around me. Having a background in psychology and working in social services has helped me 
                to become flexible in many different ways while working with others. I want to utilize my technical, social, 
                and creative abilities to make this dream a reality and to pursue the next chapter in my life.
